The anticipation for the release of CentOS 5.4 has been an exciting wait. So believe me when I say I was excited to read a blog post by Dag Wieers posted today **&#8220;So, CentOS 5.4 has been released to mirrors&#8221;.**

So time to knuckle down and start planning the update from CentOS 5.3 to CentOS 5.4, first step is adding the CentOS 5.4 yum repository to our local yum repository.

So, CentOS 5.4 has been released to mirrors and will be available soon as updates to your existing systems. This ends about 6 weeks of suspended security fixes, although some security fixes were released in the CentOS 5.3 repository before the actual 5.4 release was ready.

Most of what is new can be found from my earlier RHEL5.4 release blog post.

Enjoy!
