Message from Karanbir Singh on the [CentOS lists](http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2013-December/020032.html "CentOS List")

Karanbir Singh <<A HREF="http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-announce">kbsingh at centos.org</A>>  
The CentOS Project {<A HREF="http://www.centos.org}">http://www.centos.org}</A>  
irc: <A HREF="http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-announce">z00dax at irc.freenode.net</A> ( #centos, #centos-devel )  
&#8212;&#8211;

We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of CentOS-6.5 install media for i386 and x86_64 Architectures. Release Notes for 6.5 are available at <A HREF="http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS6.5">http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS6.5</A> &#8211; we recommend everyone looks through those once.

CentOS-6.5 is based on the upstream release EL 6.5 and includes packages from all variants. All upstream repositories have been combined into one, to make it easier for end users to work with.

There are many fundamental changes in this release, compared with the past CentOS-6 releases, and we highly recommend everyone stufy the Release Notes as well as the upstream Techical Notes about the changes and how they might impact your installation.

All updates released since upstream 6.5 release are also released to the CentOS-6.5 mirrors.

Everyone who has centos-cr repositories enabled and in use, would already be running CentOs-6.5 as of one week ago and will notice only the centos-release rpm update today.

+++++++++++++++++++++++  
Upgrading from CentOS-4 or CentOS-5:

We recommend everyone run through a reinstall rather than attempt an inplace upgrade from CentOS-4 or CentOS-5.

+++++++++++++++++++++++  
Upgrading from CentOS-6.0 / 6.1 / 6.2 / 6.3 or 6.4

Unless you have edited your yum configs, a &#8216;yum update&#8217; should move your machine seamlessly from any previous CentOS-6.x release to CentOS-6.5

+++++++++++++++++++++++  
Downloading CentOS-6.5 for new installs:

When possible, consider using torrents to run the downloads. Usually its also the fastest means to download the distro.

Torrent files for the DVD&#8217;s are available at :  
<A HREF="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6.5/isos/i386/CentOS-6.5-i386-bin-DVD1to2.torrent">http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6.5/isos/i386/CentOS-6.5-i386-bin-DVD1to2.torrent</A>  
<A HREF="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6.5/isos/x86_64/CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1to2.torrent">http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6.5/isos/x86_64/CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1to2.torrent</A>

You can also use a mirror close to you :  
<A HREF="http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=30">http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=30</A>

Most mirrors will allow direct DVD downloads over http, ftp and rsync.

Please keep in mind that not all mirrors are currently updated, some might take upto another 24 hours before they have all the content.

We have also made efforts to try and ensure that most install types and roles can be run from DVD-1 itself.

Cloud Images

Images for various on-preimse and off-premise Cloud environments are currently under development for CentOS-6.5 and will be released in the coming days. Everyone looking to join and help with the CentOS Cloud efforts is encouraged to join the CentOS-Virt list where such issues are discussed ( <A HREF="http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-virt">http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-virt</A> ).

+++++++++++++++++++++++  
Getting Help:

The best place to start when looking for help with CentOS is at the wiki ( <A HREF="http://wiki.centos.org/GettingHelp">http://wiki.centos.org/GettingHelp</A> ) which lists various options and communities who might be able to help. If you think there is a bug in the system, do report it at <A HREF="http://bugs.centos.org/">http://bugs.centos.org/</A> &#8211; but keep in mind  
that the bugs system is \*not\* a support mechanism.

+++++++++++++++++++++++  
Metups and training sessions

The next CentOS Dojo is going to take place at Austin, TX, USA on the 6th December 2013. Details on the day, venue and registration are  
available at <A HREF="http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Austin2013">http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Austin2013</A>

As 2014 comes up, we&#8217;ve started planning for the Dojo Schedules for the next year. If you would like to get involved in helping organising, running, presenting or sponsoring a Dojo or even just want more detail do get in touch with us at the CentOS Promo list (<A HREF="http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-promo">http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-promo</A>)

+++++++++++++++++++++++  
Contributing and joining the project:

We are always looking for people to join and help with various things in the project. If you are keen to help out a good place to start is the  
wiki page at <A HREF="http://wiki.centos.org/Contribute">http://wiki.centos.org/Contribute</A> . If you have questions or a specific area you would like to contribute towards that is not covered on that page, feel free to drop in on #<A HREF="http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-announce">centos-devel at irc.freenode.net</A> for a chat or email the centos-devel list (<A HREF="http://lists.centos.org">http://lists.centos.org</A>).

+++++++++++++++++++++++  
Thanks to everyone who contributed towards making CentOS 6.5, specially the effort put in, as always, by the QA and Build team.

A special shout out to all the donors who have contributed hardware, network connectivity, hosting and resources over the years. The CentOS project now has a fairly well setup resource pool, purely thanks to the donors.

Enjoy!
